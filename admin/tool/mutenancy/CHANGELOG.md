- Added tenantid in core WS: core_user_create_users, core_user_get_users_by_field, core_user_get_users 
- Added web services for management of tenants.
- Tenant switching has been simplified: associated users and tenant managers can now switch tenants by default.

Existing tenant manager roles need to be updated manually to include the switch permission.
